## Why should we study OS?
- Technical perspective
OS is essential to understand how computers work under the hood
<br>
OS is a key technology of computer systems

- Business Perspective
OS creates and dominates the ecosystem
1. Lock-in
If an user gets used to specific OS, user will have problem getting used to another OS.
2. Chrun-in
When users are attracted to a particular os, developers create applications, hardware, and it introduces new users to create a virtuous cycle.

## What Makes It Difficult?
- System software that provides an execution environment for applications. System software between applications and hardware.
Different users have diverse views to OS. For example, App developers and Device manufacturers ahve different perspective and views. In this course, we can experience OS as a view of OS developers.
- OS have huge and complex structure. For example, Linux has 18 million lines of code and Windows XP has 45 million lines of codes. In case of Red Hat Linux version 7.1, it contains over 30 million lines and it is about 8000 man-years of development effort.
- Too many bugs. Steve McConnell said that "about 15-50 errors per 1000 lines of code" but there are more than 18 million lines of code in Linux
- Difficult to Develop and Own. Interfacing with hardware and application software. Which implies that highest form of SW in CS, expert developers are needed.

## Recent Trends
- Distributed and Cloud: OS for Big Computer Systems
- OS for small manycore processors
- OS for connected computing: IoT and Wearable Computing
- Next Generation Technology and Changes (ex. NVRAM, Autonomous Driving, AR/VR, Deep Learning, etc.)
