## Scoring diving competitions
<br>
The grading team consists of five people to enter the difficulty level and the scores of each grading officer. Save it using an array.
<br>
Calculate the final score by multiplying the difficulty by adding scores except the highest and the lowest score among the scores received.
<br>
Ask if you want to continue after the score is calculated so that you can keep typing.
