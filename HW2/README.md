## Calculator
<br>
Design a program that calculates the arithmetic operation by printing the menu.
<br>
It receives two numbers and outputs the results of the selected operation.
<br>
In case of division, print out the error if the second number is zero.
<br>
Repeat until the menu is zeroed in. If the wrong menu number is entered, re-print the menu.
